# 2020 Portfolio
 
    This portfolio replaces my 2019 with a complete new look, level of coding, 
    and a more intuitive design. My last portfolio was limited by my coding skills so it was only showing simple HTML and CSS. I made a point to include JavaScript and CSS/HTML items such as letting the user create an email, scroll through projects, and see movement throughout the page.
 
# Future add's
 
    - A link including more pictures and details from that project
    - Include more projects once that is complete
    - Update pictures and themes using my own art works
    - Add a recommendation section for people to give testimonies 

# Main Struggles While Creating

    - Getting the bottom section to create an email in which the viewer can send to me 
    - Understanding how the light box works 
    - Getting everything to animate correctly
    - Selecting the best content for the viewer
    - Making it "me" and not a generic website
